# famfamfam-css
FamFamFam Icons compiled into Cascading Style Sheets.

## How do I use it?
If you would like to use the flags, you will need css/flags.css (or flags.min.css) and res/flags.gif.

If you would like to use the silk icons, you will need css/silk_icons.css (or silk_icons.min.css) and res/silk_icons.png.

## How do I include it?
Go into your html file, and create a link tag: ``<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/silk_icons.min.css">``, reference like ``<i class="silk silk-accept"></i>`` and then you're pretty much good to go.

## How do I know what names refer to what?
For Silk Icons, you could look at the FamFamFam Silk Icon <a href="http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/previews/index_abc.png">Glossary</a>.
For Flags, you could look up the country code with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code set</a>.

## How did you make this?
I compiled the spritesheets and stylesheets with a simple java script. The CSS file(s) you have orders the flags/icons from left-to-right.

## Who made the icons?
The icons are made by Mark James, developer and owner of the popular <a href="http://famfamfam.com/">FamFamFam</a>.

## How are these licensed?
The Spritesheets are owned by Mark James; I just modified them with a quick java script. The flags are public domain, but the icons are under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">cc-by-2.5</a> which just requires attribution to the original author/artist and notification of change.
