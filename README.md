# famfamfam-css
FamFamFam Icons compiled into Cascading Style Sheets.

## How do I use it?
If you would like to use the flags, you will need css/flags.css (or flags.min.css) and res/flags.gif.

If you would like to use the silk icons, you will need css/silk_icons.css (or silk_icons.min.css) and res/silk_icons.png.

## but how do I include it?
Go into your html file, and create a link tag: <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/silk_icons.min.css">, reference like <i class="silk silk-accept"></i> and then you're pretty much good to go.

## How did you make this?
I compiled the spritesheets and stylesheets with a simple java script. The CSS file(s) you have orders the flags/icons from left-to-right.
