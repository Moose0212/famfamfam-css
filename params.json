The CSS file(s) you have orders the flags/icons from left-to-right.\r\n\r\n## Who made the icons?\r\nThe icons are made by Mark James, developer and owner of the popular <a href=\"http://famfamfam.com/\">FamFamFam</a>.\r\n\r\n## How are these licensed?\r\nThe Spritesheets are owned by Mark James; I just modified them with a quick java script. The flags are public domain, but the icons are under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/\">cc-by-2.5</a> which just requires attribution to the original author/artist and notification of change.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
